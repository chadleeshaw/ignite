Ignite is a powerful, all-in-one solution for network booting and server provisioning, implemented in Go. It simplifies the complexities of setting up network boot environments by integrating DHCP, TFTP, and a web-based management interface into a single, easy-to-use application.

## üèÜ Quality & Testing

Ignite features comprehensive test coverage across all components:

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: All packages include extensive test suites with mock implementations
- **Integration Testing**: VM-based testing with QEMU for end-to-end PXE boot validation  
- **Test Coverage**: Significant coverage across core packages (osimage, syslinux, handlers, routes, vmtest)
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated formatting (`gofmt`) and static analysis (`go vet`) validation

## Overview

Designed for developers, system administrators, and hobbyists, Ignite provides a streamlined workflow for managing PXE boot environments. Whether you're deploying operating systems, running diagnostics, or managing server configurations, Ignite offers the tools you need to get the job done efficiently.

## Features

- **Integrated DHCP Server**: Dynamically assign IP addresses to network devices.
- **Built-in TFTP Server**: Serve boot files (e.g., PXELinux, iPXE) to booting clients.
- **Web-Based Management UI**: A user-friendly interface to manage DHCP leases, configure boot menus, and monitor server status.
- **Dynamic PXE Boot Menu Templating**: Automatically generate PXE boot menus for different operating systems based on DHCP leases. Supported templates include:
  - Ubuntu
  - NixOS
  - Red Hat
- **Redfish API Integration**: Remotely manage servers and initiate PXE boot processes via the Redfish API.
- **Cloud-Init & Kickstart Templating**: Simplify automated OS installations with dynamic templating for cloud-init and Kickstart configurations.
- **Advanced File Management**: Template and configuration file browser with delete functionality and clear type distinction.
- **Enhanced Security**: Path validation, input sanitization, and secure file operations throughout the application.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages, validation feedback, and graceful error recovery.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.21 or higher (tested with Go 1.23.4).
- **Node.js & npm**: For managing frontend dependencies.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the web interface.
- **QEMU** (optional): For running integration tests (`qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-img`).
- **curl**: For API testing and health checks.
- A basic understanding of network booting concepts (DHCP, TFTP, PXE).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ignite.git
   cd ignite
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:

   The easiest way to get started is by using the provided Makefile:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   This command will handle installing dependencies, building the CSS, and running the application.

3. **Access the Web UI**:

   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### Development & Testing

**Running Tests**:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run vmtest integration tests (requires QEMU)
cd vmtest
go run vmtest.go 1    # Test boot files with QEMU built-in TFTP
go run vmtest.go 2    # Test ignite integration
go run vmtest.go logs # Show test logs
go run vmtest.go clean # Clean up test files
```

**Code Quality**:

```bash
# Format code
gofmt -w .

# Run static analysis
go vet ./...
```

**CLI Options**:

```bash
# Populate with mock data for testing
./ignite -mock-data

# Clear all data
./ignite -clear-data
```

## Architecture

Ignite follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Packages

- **`app/`**: Application lifecycle, dependency injection, and service orchestration
- **`dhcp/`**: DHCP server implementation with lease management and reservation support
- **`tftp/`**: TFTP server for serving boot files and OS images
- **`handlers/`**: HTTP request handlers with dependency injection for web API endpoints
- **`routes/`**: HTTP routing configuration and middleware setup
- **`config/`**: Configuration management with environment variable support
- **`db/`**: Database abstraction layer using BoltDB for persistent storage

### Specialized Components

- **`osimage/`**: OS image management with download tracking and file operations
- **`syslinux/`**: SYSLINUX boot file management and menu generation
- **`ipxe/`**: iPXE configuration generation and template rendering
- **`vmtest/`**: Integration testing framework using QEMU for end-to-end PXE testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage with mock implementations for all external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Real-world testing using QEMU VMs to validate PXE boot workflows
- **Mock Services**: Testify-based mocks for database operations, file system interactions, and external services

## vmtest Integration Testing

The `vmtest/` package provides comprehensive integration testing capabilities:

```bash
cd vmtest
./setup-boot-files.sh    # One-time setup: download SYSLINUX boot files

# Test boot files with QEMU built-in TFTP (validates PXE menu display)
go run vmtest.go 1

# Test full ignite integration (DHCP server, API endpoints, VM boot)
go run vmtest.go 2

# View test results and VM serial output
go run vmtest.go logs

# Clean up test artifacts
go run vmtest.go clean
```

Integration tests validate:
- SYSLINUX boot file functionality
- DHCP server API endpoints
- Ignite web interface responsiveness  
- End-to-end PXE boot workflows
- VM network boot scenarios

## Deployment Options

### **Docker Deployment (Recommended)**

#### **Option 1: Pre-built Image**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ignite \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 69:69/udp \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \

  ghcr.io/chadleeshaw/ignite:v2.0.0
```

#### **Option 2: Build from Source**
```bash
# Full build (requires Go toolchain in container)
docker build -t ignite:local .

# Quick build using release binary (faster, smaller image)
docker build -f Dockerfile.release -t ignite:release .
docker run -d --name ignite -p 8080:8080 -p 69:69/udp ignite:release
```

### **Binary Installation**

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced monitoring** - Metrics collection and alerting for system health
- **API versioning** - Backward compatibility and gradual migration support
- **Plugin architecture** - Extensible framework for custom integrations
- **Configuration templating** - Variable substitution and environment-specific configs
